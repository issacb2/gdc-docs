# GISTIC Copy Number Score #

## Description ##
Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) is a tool to identify frequent somatic copy number alterations.

## Overview ##
GDC uses this workflow to generate gene-level copy number thresholded scores that support copy number visualization. This workflow is only run for TCGA, and later replaced by ASCAT derived integer copy number segments and gene-level copy numbers..
